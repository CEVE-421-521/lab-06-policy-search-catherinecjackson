        "    Our decision variable is the height at which we elevate the house.  We want to know which elevation height finds the best balance between the cost of raising a home and the future flood damages we might avoid.  In this way, our objective function determines how much a given decision will cost us over a certain future time period.  We want to minimize this cost.  The states of the world are the different scenarios of sea level rise, storm surge, and discount rates that we might encounter in the future.  \n",
        "2. Digging deeper, we are averaging the objective function computed over a finite number of states of the world. This assumes that they are all drawn from a distribution representing the \"true\" distribution of states of the world. Is this a good assumption?\n",
        "    Scientists and researchers, though they can make valuable predictions, can never know for sure what the true distribution of the future state of the world is.  There will be unexpected outcomes, etc.  This model then uses our \"best guess\" of what the future might look like, but it may not necessarily be representative of the true future.  This is a limitation of our analysis.\n",
        "3. What's not being considered in this analysis that might be important?\n",
        "    There are of course many other added complexities that could be added to this model.  Given my background in flood modeling, I notice that this model considers storm surge, but it does not consider any flooding caused by rainfall.  Often, homes close to the coast are particularly vulnerable to *compound flooding* or the combined effects of storm surge and heavy rainfall (both pluvial and fluvial flooding).  This would be an interesting addition to the model.  \n",
        "    In addition, the model does not consider the potential for future mitigation measures.  As the home I study is in Galveston, it could be impacted by future projects like the Coastal Spine and the Galveston Bay Park Plan.\n",
        "    Finally, the model does not consider the potential for future land use changes (e.g. continuing development of the island)."
